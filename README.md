The following program wants to solve the problem of the integration of the Lorenz system and what is its sensibility to initial conditions.
The numerical integration is done using the Euler forward method and the study of sensitivity on intial conditions is done by perturbing the initial condition first with a 4 predetermined perturbations, secondly with an ensemble of random perturbations.
